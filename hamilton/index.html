                The history of Hamilton is complex and not linear. The route for this walking tour attempts to follow chronologically the development of Hamilton as well as the history. We will begin at the water, as the was the place where the earliest development occurred with the construction of Fort Hamilton. Then, we will explore the early development and history of Hamilton at the Butler County Courthouse and central business district. Next, we will explore a diverse neighborhood called the German Village Historic District. We will then look at an abandoned factory and explore the complicated relationship that Hamilton has with manufacturing. We will then visit a brand-new park that is bringing new life into the city and look at a new development that will change the face of the city.

        <p class="text">  The story of Hamilton, like most places, begins at the water. The Great Miami River is a tributary of the Ohio river that runs from the Dayton area to southeastern Ohio, outside of Cincinnati. Itâ€™s no coincidence that a city like Hamilton is centered at a waterway of this magnitude. The river was a source of life that enabled much of the early growth of the city. In the landscape of the river we can see the that the edges of the river have been supported and dredged, this suggests that the river still has some modern uses. Although, I would imagine that the types of boats travelling on the river are not that large because the bridge only leaves about 15-20ft of clearance above the waterway. The Great Miami River also fed the water for the Miami and Erie Canal starting in the 1830s and peaking in the 1850s. The canal in combination with the river contributed to much of the early growth of Hamilton. The former towpath for the canal is now a multipurpose trail that can be used for bike travel or recreation.    </p>

                <p class="text">  The history of Hamilton begins with Fort Hamilton. A plaque stands here today where the fort originally stood. The fort was one of many along the Great Miami River designed to be a supply depot for American expeditions against Native Americans living along the Great Miami River and other surrounding streams. This was the first American settlement in present-day Hamilton, being completed in 1791. The fort and the subsequent city were named after Alexander Hamilton, a friend of General Arthur St. Clair who was responsible for constructing the original fort. The fort is long gone. It was dismantled after the American victory against the natives following the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. The Powder House was saved from demolition and stood until 1913 when a flood destroyed much of the town. Presently, at the site of the for the Soldiers, Sailors and Pioneers Monument stands. It was constructed in 1902 to commemorate the men and women of Butler County who served in the Revolutionary, Indian, Spanish American, 1812, Desert Storm, and Mexican Wars as well as to commemorate early settlers of Butler County. The vast marble structure contains over 4,500 names of those who have served our country. From the steps of the monument, you can see a clear view eastward down High Street at downtown Hamilton.  </p>

                        <p class="text"> The next stop on our tour is just down the block at the Butler County Courthouse. The aforementioned canal system and railroads brought many industries to Hamilton in the early to mid 1800s. Hamilton turned into a small, but mighty producer of manufactured goods and was a hub for transporting resources from southern Ohio and eastern Indiana to other parts of the country. This growth of industry brought many people to Hamilton looking for work. The population increased rapidly with the railroads and the canals. In 1880, Hamilton had a population of over 12,000. This population growth also triggered a growth of infrastructure. The Butler County Courthouse is the perfect manifestation of these infrastructure investments. It was constructed between 1885-1889 in the Second Empire style. The courthouse is four stories and features a mansard roof and many ornate window decorations.  It sits on a plot of land that is slightly elevated from the normal road height, likely to symbolize the importance and significance of the structure. The courthouse is primarily surrounded by other government buildings. The post office built later sits behind the courthouse. The Butler County Administrative Center sits across High street, in front of the courthouse. This structure certainly stands out in the landscape as a place of importance. Later in the tour, we will look at houses in neighborhoods built around the time of this courthouse, to get a better understanding of how people were living at the time.  </p>
