<h3> My name is Benjamin Ernest Boczulak </h3>

<img class="about" src="ben.jpeg">

<p>  I am a student living in Cleveland, Ohio. Since a young age I had developed a connection with technology that has given me so many great opportunities. At the age of 9, I built my first website to share my lego creations - at peak revenue the website was bringing in $100 a month. At the age of 12 I released my first single, Malibu Beaches, I ran an aggressive marketing campaign that increased sales 10 fold. The music venture spanned 3 years and 16 songs but sadly came to an end in May, 2016. Also in 2012 at the age of 12 I launched my YouTube channel which since has seen 150,000+ views. Now, I am focused on my social media presences as well as my marketable skills. I will graduate High School in 2018.
