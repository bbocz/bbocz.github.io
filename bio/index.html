<br>

Genetic Drift &#8211; Change in a gene pool of a small population due to chance. <br>
Bottleneck Effect &#8211; An event that shrinks a population to a smaller
size. Only the traits of the individuals that survived will be passed
on to next generations. <br>
Founder Effect &#8211; A small group moving to a new area.<br>
Genetic Equilibrium &#8211; no evolution<br>
Hardy-Weinberg Principle - Evolution will not occur when the following conditions are met:<br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natural Selection does not occur<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The population is very large<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The population is isolated<br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no mutations<br>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mating is random<br>
<br>
Sexual Selection &#8211; The natural selection arising through preference by
one sex for certain characteristics in individuals of the other sex. <br>
Species &#8211; A group of organisms that breed with one another and produce fertile offspring. <br>
Speciation &#8211; formation of new species<br>
Reproductive Isolation &#8211; separation of species or populations so that they cannot interbreed and produce fertile offspring<br>
Behavioral Isolation &#8211; occurs when 2 populations are capable of
interbreeding by have differences in courtship rituals or other type of
behavior. <br>
Geographical Isolation &#8211; 2 populations are separated by geographic barriers<br>
Temporal Isolation &#8211; 2 or more species reproduce at different times<br>
Molecular Clock &#8211; using amino acids to detect similarities in organisms. <br>
<br>
Chapter 18<br>
<br>
Binomial Nomenclature &#8211; Classification system in which each species is assigned a two-part scientific name<br>
Genus &#8211; Group of closely related species; the first part of the scientific name in binomial nomenclature<br>
Systematics &#8211; the study of the diversity of life and the evolutionary relationships between organisms<br>
Taxon &#8211; group or level of organization into which organisms are classified<br>
Phylogeny &#8211; Study of evolutionary relationships among organisms<br>
Clade &#8211; evolutionary branch of a cladogram that includes a single ancestor and all its decedents<br>
Monophyletic Group &#8211; group the consists of a single ancestral species
and all of its descendants and excludes any organisms that are not
descended from that common ancestor<br>
Cladogram &#8211; diagram depicting patterns of shared characteristics among species<br>
Domain &#8211; A larger, more inclusive taxonomic category than a kingdom<br>
Bacteria &#8211; domain of unicellular prokaryotes that have cell walls and contain peptidoglycan<br>
Archaea &#8211; domain consisting of unicellular prokaryotes that have cell walls and don&#8217;t contain peptidoglycan<br>
<br>
Chapter 19<br>
Gradualism &#8211; The evolution of species by gradual accumulation of small genetic changes over a long period of time<br>
Punctuated Equilibrium &#8211; A pattern of evolution in which long stable
periods are interrupted by brief periods of more rapid change<br>
Adaptive Radiation &#8211; Process by which a single species or small group
of species evolves into several different forms that live in different
ways<br>
Convergent Evolution &#8211; Process by which unrelated organisms
independently evolve similarities when adapting to similar environments<br>
Coevolution &#8211; Process by which two species evolve in a response to changes in each other over time<br>
Endosymbiotic Theory &#8211; Theory that proposes that eukaryotic cells formed from a symbiotic relationship between prokaryotic cells<br>
<br>
Chapter 20<br>
<br>
Virus &#8211; A particle made of proteins, nucleic acids, and sometimes lipids that can replicate but only by infecting living cells<br>
Capsid &#8211; Protein coast surrounding a virus<br>
Bacteriophage &#8211; Virus that infects bacteria<br>
Lytic Infection &#8211; Type of infection in which a virus enters a cell, makes copies of itself, and causes the cell to burst<br>
Lysogenic Infection &#8211; Type of infection in which a virus embeds its DNA
into the DNA of the host cell and is replicated along with the host cell<br>
Prophage &#8211; Bacteriophage DNA that is embedded in the bacterial host&#8217;s DNA<br>
